question;ground_truth
Across all three RFPs, list the top five digital capabilities the companies demand and explain why those capabilities matter to their industries.;"Top 5 capabilities: 1) Integration with ERP/TMS/finance systems (NovaGrid, AtlasVentures) – critical for straight‑through processing; 2) Real‑time reporting / transaction visibility (NovaGrid, AtlasVentures) – enables instant liquidity and spend control; 3) Global payments / card‑issuance infrastructure (NovaGrid, AtlasVentures, Aviation) – supports multinational operations; 4) Mobile‑first UX & dashboards (NovaGrid dashboards, AtlasVentures mobile‑first) – improves user adoption and control; 5) ESG / sustainability‑linked banking solutions (NovaGrid ESG‑linked instruments, Aviation sustainability pillar) – aligns with each firm’s sustainable‑growth goals."
Summarise the ESG‐related banking expectations each company expresses. How do they differ between an energy developer, a consultancy, and an airline‑startup?;"NovaGrid explicitly requests ESG‑linked financial instruments and sustainability‑reporting metrics; AtlasVentures makes no explicit ESG request; Aviation RFP lists Sustainability as a core evaluation pillar and seeks a partner that supports sustainable growth. Thus, the energy firm wants concrete ESG products, the consultancy is silent, and the airline emphasises strategic sustainability alignment."
Identify every mention of regulatory, KYC, or sanctions compliance and produce a single consolidated risk checklist.;"• NovaGrid – KYC/Onboarding efficiency, risk management.
• AtlasVentures – Security standards & incident‑response obligations.
• Aviation – Compliance with international sanctions, AML, anti‑corruption, export‑control laws.
Checklist: global KYC/AML screening, sanctions checks, anti‑corruption controls, export‑control compliance, security & incident‑response procedures, ongoing risk monitoring."
Which RFPs request real‑time reporting and how does each define ‘real‑time’ or ‘dashboard’?;NovaGrid: ‘Real‑Time Reporting and Dashboards’—on‑demand liquidity and payment data. AtlasVentures: ‘Real‑Time Transaction Visibility’ via its expense platform. Aviation RFP does not mention real‑time reporting.
Compare the integration requirements with ERP/TMS across the documents and rank them by integration complexity.;1) AtlasVentures – must integrate directly with Workday and SAP Concur via APIs (highest complexity). 2) NovaGrid – generic integration with TMS/ERP systems (moderate). 3) Aviation – only high‑level ‘Integration’ criterion, no specific system named (lowest).
Which banking capabilities appear in exactly two of the three RFPs? List them and name the two companies.;"• Real‑time reporting / transaction visibility – NovaGrid & AtlasVentures.
• Integration with ERP/TMS systems – NovaGrid & AtlasVentures.
• Sustainability / ESG banking support – NovaGrid & Aviation."
What is NovaGrid’s target renewable capacity for 2030 and where is this stated?;20 GW by 2030, stated in the NovaGrid Company Background section (Energy Portfolio bullet).
Give the deadline for bank proposals in the aviation RFP and its time zone.;5:00 pm ZZZ time on 1 Aug 2024.
Which RFP mentions AI/ML‑based policy enforcement, and quote the exact sentence.;AtlasVentures RFP: “AI/ML‑Based Policy Enforcement”.
NovaGrid wants FX hedging and ESG‑linked instruments. Draft a short rationale showing how a single bank could meet both needs.;"A bank can structure an ESG‑linked revolving credit facility whose pricing adjusts to NovaGrid’s sustainability KPIs while bundling bespoke FX hedging (for example, cross‑currency swaps) to lock in project cash‑flows; delivering both sustainability financing and currency‑risk mitigation in one coordinated package."
Based on G1’s answer, drill down on the mobile‑first UX requirement—detail what KPIs AtlasVentures might track.;Suggested KPIs: mobile app adoption rate, average expense submission‑to‑approval time, real‑time spend visibility latency, policy compliance hit‑rate, user satisfaction (CSAT) score, failed transaction rate.
Produce a one‑paragraph executive summary that would brief a bank’s steering committee on common pain points these clients face when expanding internationally.;All three clients struggle with global liquidity and payment visibility, fragmented system integrations, stringent multi‑jurisdictional compliance (KYC, sanctions, AML), and an increasing need to demonstrate ESG credentials. They therefore seek a banking partner that provides real‑time, integrated, sustainable solutions at competitive pricing.
