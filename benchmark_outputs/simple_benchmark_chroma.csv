To determine the interval from the RFP issuance to the proposal deadline, we can calculate the number of days between these two dates.

1. **RFP Issuance Date**: 25 June 2024
2. **Proposal Deadline**: 2 August 2024

To calculate the number of days between these two dates:

- From 25 June to 30 June: 5 days (25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30)

1. **AI/ML-Driven Policy Enforcement**: The document mentions ""Policy Automation and AI Controls,"" indicating that the RFP includes a requirement for the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate and enforce policies.
